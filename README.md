# Simple WebApp

Taken with gratitude from [Miguel Grinberg's Awesome Flask Mega Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world), with [this Github repo](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog).

## Repurposed Bootstrap-based SPA

Originally was: "A decently featured microblogging web application written in Python and Flask that I'm developing in my Flask Mega-Tutorial series," but I've repurposed it to hold a very minimal Bootstrap-themed SPA.

## Installation

Miguel's tutorial referenced above explains how to setup a virtual environment with all the required modules.

## Running
To run the application in the development web server just execute `run.py` with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
